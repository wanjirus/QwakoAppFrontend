                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Elimu Trees is a dedicated initiative by the Ministry of Education - Kenya,
                        with a profound mission to cultivate a greener and more sustainable environment.
                        Our goal is to engage Learners, staff, ministry of education directorates, and enthusiastic volunteers
                        in planting trees and nurturing them until they thrive. We believe in the transformative
                        power of education in environmental stewardship.</p>

                    <h2>Why Trees Matter</h2>
                    <p>Trees play a pivotal role in maintaining ecological balance, improving air quality,
                        conserving biodiversity, and mitigating the effects of climate change. Beyond these environmental benefits,
                        they create serene and peaceful spaces where communities can learn, grow, and prosper. By planting trees,
                        we empower future generations to take ownership of their environment.</p>

                    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                    <p>At Elimu Trees, we believe in the power of collaboration. We work closely with learning institutions,
                        semi autonomus government agencies (SAGA's), all the directorates under Ministry of Education and other stake holders to identify suitable locations for tree planting.
                        learners and staff of all the institutions under the Ministry of education play an active role in the process, learning the importance of environmental conservation while
                        gaining practical experience. We provide the tools, knowledge, and resources needed to nurture the trees as they grow.</p>
